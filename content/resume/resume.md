## Summary
I build end-to-end autonomous and AI systems—robotics, edge AI/IoT, and applied ML—from research to field deployment with measured impact. AI/ML and robotics engineer shipping production systems across embedded sensing, computer vision/SLAM, and automation with reproducible pipelines and observability.

## Core Skills
- **Robotics/Autonomy:** SLAM (RTAB-Map), ROS 2 basics, kinematics, IMU fusion
- **CV/ML:** YOLOv5/v8, CNNs, RAG, embeddings, OpenRouter
- **Edge/IoT:** ESP32/ESP32-S3, ESP32-CAM, LoRa (SX1262), MQTT, PCA9685
- **Data/Geo:** QGIS, AlphaEarth embeddings (PCA/KMeans layers), GDAL
- **Systems:** Python, C/C++, FastAPI/Flask, SQLite/Redis, WebSockets, Docker basics
- **Frontend:** Streamlit, basic React/JS, GitHub Pages

## Experience
### Research Assistant (AI & Smart Systems) · Environment and Sustainable Development Unit (ESDU), American University of Beirut

*Sep 2024 – Present*
- Built an AI-driven energy optimization system with ESP32 sensors, YOLO presence detection, and smart automation, saving 12.47 kWh/day, reducing 24.25 kg CO₂/day, and delivering 11.41% annual ROI; deployed on-site with local dashboards.
- Developed a RAG chatbot for agricultural advisors using curated PDF ingestion, vector search, and multi-LLM inference to accelerate field decision-making with auditable sources.
- Led RELEAF geospatial dashboard delivery by shaping data pipelines, AlphaEarth embedding layers, and policy-aligned analytics covering more than 50 farms.
- Advanced EcoStrider hexapod R&D by integrating stereo ESP32-CAM SLAM, IMU fusion, and load-cell feedback for terrain-aware gait experimentation; coordinated cross-functional demos and forums including UNESCO and Lebanon National AI Summit presentations.

### Head of IT · TomVR

*Apr 2024 – Jan 2025*
- Maintained VR/AR systems with ~98% uptime by standardizing diagnostics, automations, and documentation across hardware and content pipelines.
- Implemented monitoring and response playbooks that reduced recurring incidents and improved support throughput for on-site experiences.

### Coding Instructor · BrightChamps

*May 2023 – Jan 2024*
- Delivered multilingual Python and JavaScript curricula with project-based mentorship, increasing learner engagement and completion.
- Guided student-built automation and game prototypes emphasizing algorithmic thinking and iterative feedback loops.
